        <h2>The T-80 is a main battle tank (MBT) that was designed and manufactured in the former Soviet Union and manufactured in Russia. The T-80 is based on the T-64, while incorporating features from the later T-72. The chief designer of the T-80 was Soviet engineer Nikolay Popov. When it entered service in 1976, it was the second MBT in the world to be equipped with a gas turbine engine, after the Swedish Stridsvagn 103, and the first production tank to use it as a main propulsion engine (the first tank to use a gas turbine as a main engine was the prototype British Conqueror FV200 Turbine Test Vehicle). The T-80U was last produced in 2001 in a factory in Omsk, Russia.</h2>
